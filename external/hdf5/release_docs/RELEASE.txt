Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.5 Release
==================================

    Library
    -------
        - Fixed several bugs with writing fill values for datasets that have
            a variable-length datatype or component datatype.  QAK - 2007/06/19
        - STDIO driver didn't support files bigger than 2GB because the OFFSET
            parameter of fseek is of type LONG INT, not big enough for big 
            files.  Use fseeko instead for big files if it's available on the 
            system.  SLU - 2007/4/5
        - Relaxed restrictions on attribute operations to allow a file ID to
            be used as the "location ID".  If a file ID is used, the attribute
            operation will occur on the root group of the file.
            QAK - 2007/02/09
        - Fixed a bug in H5Sselect_valid() that caused an incorrect value to
            be returned (0) instead of FAIL on error conditions such as the
            selection or extent not being defined. CMC - 2007/01/05
        - Fixed potential file corruption bug which could overwrite a portion
            of an object's header when an attribute was renamed.  If the new
            name for the attribute was longer than the old name, it was possible
            that the attribute would grow enough to overwrite another message
            in the object's header.  QAK - 2007/01/02
        - Fixed file corruption bug which could write an incorrect number of
            messages to an object's header under certain circumstances.
            Generally, the sequence of actions to generate this bug looks
            like this:
                - Create an object.
                - Close the file.
                - Re-open the file.
                - Add 2 (or more) attributes to the object.
                - Close the file.
                - Re-open the file.
                - Delete one of the attributes on the object.
                - Add a smaller attribute to the object.
                - Delete the smaller atttribute on the object.
                - Add a larger attribute on the object.

            After this, the number of header messages stored for the object
            will be off by one.  Other sequences of modifying attributes on an
            object could also trigger this bug.  If you are opening an
            object and the bottom few messages of the HDF5 error stack
            resembles the following, the object has been affected by this bug:

              #007: ../../hdf5_v1.6/src/H5C.c line 3887 in H5C_load_entry(): unable to load entry
                major(08): Meta data cache layer
                minor(40): Unable to load metadata into cache
              #008: ../../hdf5_v1.6/src/H5Ocache.c line 332 in H5O_load(): corrupt object header - too few messages
                major(12): Object header layer
                minor(40): Unable to load metadata into cache

            Specifically, "corrupt object header" is the best string to search
            for in the HDF5 error stack output.

            If your files have been affected by this bug, or you are concerned
            that your files might have been, please contact the HDF Helpdesk
            at help@hdfgroup.org for a tool to detect and repair files
            affected by this problem.  QAK - 2006/6/16

        - Fixed various problems with retrieving names of objects, especially
            with mounted files.  QAK - 2005/12/25

    Configuration
    -------------
        - Changed to default to --disable-shared if parallel is enabled. 
            AKC - 2007/5/12
        - Corrected a coding error in configure when it tries to locate the
          needed MPI and MPI-IO library for the fortran interface. 
            AKC - 007/5/9.
        - Changed default fortran compiler to g95 when gcc is used. 
            AKC - 007/2/17.
        - Configure can now use any tr command.  No more need for
            defining the variable TR, nor is it supported.  AKC - 2006/05/20

    Performance
    -------------
        - None
   
    Tools
    -----
        - Fixed a bug in h5dump regarding the display of named datatypes
            attributes. PVN - 2007/03/13
        - Fixed a bug in h5dump regarding the display of group comments. 
            PVN - 2007/03/13
        - Fixed a bug in h5dump regarding the display of hardlinks pointing 
            to the root group.  PVN - 2007/03/13
        - Fixed a bug in the h5diff percentage option -p.  PVN - 2007/03/05
        - Fixed a bug in h5dump that caused array indices greater than 2^32-1
            not to be printed correctly.  PVN - 2007/2/19

    Documentation 
    ------------- 
        - Corrected errors and extended the descriptions in Reference Manual 
            entries for several functions.  

    F90 API
    -------
        - None
                                
    C++ API
    -------
          - Changed
                  StrType::StrType(const size_t& size);
            to
                  StrType::StrType(const int dummy, const size_t& size);
            because the first one clashed with
                  StrType::StrType(const hid_t existing_id); - BMR 2007/05/03
          - Wrappers of H5Rcreate had incorrect prototypes.  Added these
            overloaded functions:
                  IdComponent::reference(void* ref, const char* name, DataSpace&
                          dataspace, H5R_type_t ref_type = H5R_DATASET_REGION)
                  IdComponent::void reference(void* ref, const char* name)
                  IdComponent::reference(void* ref, const H5std_string& name)
            and will remove these incorrect member functions:
                  DataSet::Reference
                  DataType::Reference
                  Group::Reference
                  H5File::Reference
          - Added wrappers for H5Rdereference as constructors:
                  DataSet(IdComponent& obj, void* ref);
                  Group(IdComponent& obj, void* ref);
                  DataType(IdComponent& obj, void* ref);

Compiler versions for each platform are listed in the "Platforms Tested" 
table found elsewhere in this file (RELEASE.txt).  Unless otherwise noted, 
compilers used are the system compilers.

Footnotes:
(1) Fortran compiled with g95.
(2) In most cases, shared libraries are provided only for the C library, 
    except on Windows where they are provided for C, C++, and Fortran.
(3) C++ works only with static libraries.


Known Problems
==============
* QSC (an HP alpha-based OSF1 cluster) does not create h5pfc correctly. It
  does not include the -lmpi properly.  This will be fixed in the next
  release.  AKC - 2007/08/07.

* On IRIX64 6.5 (UCAR SGI mop1), when testing HDF5 tools with an HDF5 shared
  library, especially for h5repacktst and h52gifgentst, the following (or
  similar) error message may appear:
  "523648:lt-h5repacktst: rld: Fatal Error: Cannot Successfully map soname
  'libh5test.so.1' under any of the filenames .......(bunch of directories)
  "
  And the testing will fail. 
  We believe this is a libtool problem. One way to get rid of this is to
  add the paths of libh5test.so.1 and libh5.so.1 to the shared library path.

  For 32-bit:
  You may do this, under csh:
  setenv LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH .......(existing pathes):[full path of HDF5
  directory/test/.libs]:[full path of HDF5 directory/src/.libs]

  For 64-bit:
  setenv LD_LIBRARY64_PATH ......(existing pathes):[full path of HDF5
  directory/test/.libs]:[full path of HDF5 directory/src/.libs]

  NOTE: This problem ONLY affects the testing of the HDF5 library when you 
  build from source. It won't affect any applications that would like to link 
  with the HDF5 shared library since the shared library path needs to be set 
  anyway.  KY - 2007/8/2

* QSC (an HP alpha-based OSF1 cluster) failed the testpar/testphdf5 sub-test
  "calloc".  All other tests passed.  This indicates that a dataset using 
  chunked storage created by serial HDF5 may not work properly with parallel 
  HDF5.  The calloc test can be skipped by running "prun ... testphdf5 -x 
  calloc".  AKC - 2007/7/12.

* The Intel C Compiler for the Linux x86_64 platform (EM64T-based, v8.1) has
  an optimization error in the datax types conversion code.  Before running
  configure, edit the file config/intel-flags by changing the setting of
  PROD_CFLAGS from -O3 to -O0.  Then run configure.  AKC - 2005/11/10.

* When testing parallel HDF5 with the C compiler version MIPSpro 7.4.3 on IRIX
  6.5, set the environment variable MPI_TYPE_MAX to be a bigger number, for 
  example 120000, in order to pass the complicated collective IO tests inside 
  the parallel HDF5 library. This is not a problem inside the parallel HDF5 
  library. You can always set a bigger number on your system.  KY - 2005/10/6

* A contiguous or chunked dataset created by a sequential version of HDF5 
  might not be able to be modified with a parallel version of the library. 
  Use the H5Pset_alloc_time function with H5D_ALLOC_TIME_EARLY to set up the 
  dataset creation property list to avoid the problem.  EIP - 2005/09/09

* The dataset created or rewritten with the v1.6.3 library or after can't 
  be read with the v1.6.2 library or before when Fletcher32 EDC (a filter) is 
  enabled.  There was a bug in the calculating code of the Fletcher32 
  checksum in the library before v1.6.3.  The checksum value wasn't consistent 
  between big-endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in 
  Release 1.6.3.  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value is no 
  longer the same as before on little-endian system.  The library release 
  after 1.6.4 can still read the dataset created or rewritten with the library
  of v1.6.2 or before.  SLU - 2005/7/8

* For version 6 (6.02 and 6.04) of the Portland Group compiler on AMD Opteron
  processor, there's a bug in the compiler for optimization(-O2).  The library
  failed in several tests, all related to the multi driver.  The problem has 
  been reported to the vendor.  

* test/big fails sometimes with the message "Possible overlap with another
  region."  The test selects regions randomly, and this error occurs when
  two regions overlap each other; it is a bug in the test and not in
  HDF5.  Since the error is triggered by a random situation, it will
  usually disappear if the test is re-run.

* Newer SGI MIPSpro compilers (version 7.4.x) support C99 features but 
  have a "guard" statement in stdint.h that will #error and skip the rest
  of the header file if the C99 option is not used explicitly.  Hardsetting
  $CC to c99 will resolve the problem. AKC - 2004/12/13

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command poe.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may also fail with messages like "The socket name is already
  in use".  HDF5 does not use sockets (except for stream-VFD).  This is
  due to problems of the poe command trying to set up the debug socket.
  Check whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  These 
  are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed commands.
  Ask your system administrator to clean them out.  Lastly, request IBM
  to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some platforms
  (e.g. parallel jobs, Windows) where the error messages directed to
  "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output from stdout.
  This is not an error.

* The stream-vfd test uses ip port 10007 for testing. If another
  application is already using that port address, the test will hang
  indefinitely and has to be terminated by the kill command. To try the
  test again, change the port address in test/stream_test.c to one not
  being used in the host.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system
  libraries on Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on the IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine
  with this option.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on the HPUX 11.00.
  
  It is suggested that you don't use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* The Stream VFD is not supported under Windows.

* Use the --disable-shared configure flag if building with Absoft Fortran
  compiler.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  INSTALL file sections 5.7 and 5.8.

* In LANL QSC, the new cc compiler has problems converting small values of
  long long (absolute values less than 1**-308) to double.  This triggers
  the test/dtypes to report failure in the following test:
      Testing random sw long double -> double conversions
  If -ieee is used, the converted doubles spread over the range 0.0 to 
  10**-308.  If -ieee is not used, the converted double values are mostly 
  0.0, but occasionally appear as 10**-308.  This has been reported to the 
  system staff.

  All other tests have passed.

* On at least one system, SDSC DataStar, the scheduler (in this case
  LoadLeveler) sends job status updates to standard error when you run
  any executable that was compiled with the parallel compilers.

  This causes problems when running "make check" on parallel builds, as
  many of the tool tests function by saving the output from test runs,
  and comparing it to an exemplar.

  The best solution is to reconfigure the target system so it no longer
  inserts the extra text.  However, this may not be practical.

  In such cases, one solution is to "setenv HDF5_Make_Ignore yes" prior to
  the configure and build.  This will cause "make check" to continue after
  detecting errors in the tool tests.  However, in the case of SDSC DataStar,
  it also leaves you with some 150 "failed" tests to examine by hand.

  A second solution is to write a script to run serial tests and filter
  out the text added by the scheduler.  A sample script used on SDSC
  DataStar is given below, but you will probably have to customize it
  for your installation.

  Observe that the basic idea is to insert the script as the first item
  on the command line which executes the test.  The script then
  executes the test and filters out the offending text before passing
  it on.

        #!/bin/csh

        set STDOUT_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stdout
        set STDERR_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stderr

        rm -f $STDOUT_FILE $STDERR_FILE

        ($* > $STDOUT_FILE) >& $STDERR_FILE

        set RETURN_VALUE=$status

        cat $STDOUT_FILE

        tail +3 $STDERR_FILE

        exit $RETURN_VALUE

  You get the HDF5 make files and test scripts to execute your filter script
  by setting the environment variable "RUNSERIAL" to the full path of the
  script prior to running configure for parallel builds.  Remember to
  "unsetenv RUNSERIAL" before running configure for a serial build.

  Note that the RUNSERIAL environment variable exists so that we can
  prefix serial runs as necessary on the target system.  On DataStar,
  no prefix is necessary.  However, on an MPICH system, the prefix might
  have to be set to something like "/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun -np 1" to
  get the serial tests to run at all.

  In such cases, you will have to include the regular prefix in your
  filter script.  JM - 2004/9/15
