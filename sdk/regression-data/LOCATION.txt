   When on an affy unix host, the makefile will do the right
thing and make the symlink for you:

  ln -s /nfs/bioinformatics/apt/apt-regression-data/trunk data

   On a windows host you will need to have followed the
"Building on Windows" instructions [1] to have cygwin and
junction.exe installed.  For your cut-n-paste convenience
here are the commands you need to run (in a cywin bash
shell):

NOTE: On the bamboo build hosts, we use drive "D:" for all the
      regression data.  Change the path on these hosts.

rsync -Pa --delete ora:/nfs/bioinformatics/apt/apt-regression-data/trunk /cygdrive/c/apt/apt-regression-data/trunk

c:\APT\BIN\junction.exe data C:\APT\regression-data

   Or with the bash shell on a bamboo build host:
/cygwin/d/apt/bin/junction.exe data d:\\apt\\apt-regression-data\\trunk

   You can also check out a versioned copy of the APT regression data.
To get it from svn, run the following command:

svn co svn://svn.ev.affymetrix.com/apt-regression-data/trunk data
