The Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) is a collection of command line programs
for analyzing and working with Affymetrix microarray data. These programs
are generally focused on CEL file level analysis. APT also refers to the
underlying C++ source %code. Binaries and source %code are available from
the main APT website,

<h2>History and Changes</h2>
The APT %code provides the back end analysis engine for 
<a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/estore/browse/level_seven_software_products_only.jsp?productId=131414">Expression Console</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/estore/browse/level_seven_software_products_only.jsp?productId=131535">Genotype Console</a>.
The APT packaged evolved out of an early exon array analysis package called ExACT.
