\page FILE-FORMATS File Formats

Documentation for various file formats used/generated by APT:

- <a href="gcos-agcc/index.html">GCOS and AGCC Formats</a>
    - CDF: Chip layout information. What probes are where on the chip and 
           how are they grouped into probesets.
    - CEL: Probe level intensity data on a per-chip basis.
    - CHP: Probeset summary information (ie probeset signal, genotype 
           calls, ...) on a per chip basis.

- <a href="file-format-tsv.html">Tab-Separated Values file</a>: 
  TSV is a general file format for textual information.
    - Version 1 TSV (normal)
        - <a href="file-format-bgp.html">BGP: BackGround Probes file</a>: 
          The BGP file lists what probes (by probe ID) are to be used in 
          various generic background correction methods (ie GCBG method).
        - <a href="file-format-clf.html">CLF: CEL Layout File</a>: 
          CLF along with PGF make up the core chip layout information for 
          WT-based expression designs (Gene and Exon arrays). The CLF 
          contains the mapping of probe IDs to x/y positions in the CEL 
          file. Note that this mapping may be deterministic based on CLF 
          header info.
        - <a href="file-format-csv.html">CSV: Comma-Separated Values file</a>: 
          The CSV is a general file format for textual information. While 
          not strictly a "TSV" file, it is placed in the TSV family due 
          to the use of the TsvFile parser to handle these files. 
        - <a href="file-format-gqc.html">GQC: Genotype Quality Control File</a>: 
          The GQC file contains quality assessment metrics for genotyping arrays.
        - <a href="file-format-mps.html">MPS: Meta Probeset File</a>: 
          The MPS file is used to group individual probesets into a meta probesets. 
          This is most commonly used on the WT-Based expression platform 
          to group exon level probesets into a gene level meta probeset.
        - <a href="file-format-ps.html">PS: Probeset List File</a>: 
          The PS file is used to provide a list of probeset IDs or names.
        - <a href="file-format-qca.html">QCA: Quality Control Analysis File</a>: 
          The QCA file is used to define quality assessment analysis methods 
          for genotyping arrays.
        - <a href="file-format-qcc.html">QCC: Quality Control Content File</a>: 
          The QCC file is used to define quality assessment groupings, textual 
          labels, amongst other things for genotyping and expression arrays.
        - <a href="file-format-spf.html">SPF: Simple Probe File</a>: 
          The SPF is an experimental format for specifying probe layout 
          information. 
    - Version 2 (hierarchical)
        - <a href="file-format-pgf.html">Probe Group File (PGF)</a>: 
          PGF along with CLF make up the core chip layout information 
          for WT-based expression designs (Gene and Exon arrays). The 
          PGF groups specific probes (by probe ID) into probe sets.

- HDF5 (a5) %file: 
  HDF5 is a binary file format.
    - Copynumber Reference format (REF)
        - <a href="FILE-FORMAT-ref.html">REF: CN5 Reference file</a>: 
          Copynumber Reference format (REF) is a hdf5 binary representation of the data needed to run the copynumber single sample workflow.
