   This SDK is a collection of code used by other SDKs to
write portable code.  The two systems we care about are unix
and windows.

   Each of the files in this SDK should explain when it is
needed and how it is to be used.

   Questions about this sdk should be sent to
sdk-dev@ev.affymetrix.com.  Changes should be discussed
before committed as this module (is/will be) used by many.
